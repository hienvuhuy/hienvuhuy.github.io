    - Coreference-guided Neural Machine Translation We proposed a novel method to exploit coreference information in the decoder side of the encoder–decoder based machine translation system at document level.
    - Context-Aware Machine Translation with Coreference Information We introduced a model that explains the decisions made for translation by predicting coreference features in the source input [\[paper\].](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19505)

- 2012 – 2019: Researcher
  - University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University – supervised by Assoc. Prof. [Phuong-Thai Nguyen](http://uet.vnu.edu.vn/~thainp/index.htm)
    - Japanese–Vietnamese Machine Translation System in Business Do- mains(granted by Department of Science and Technology - Hanoi city) We developed a specialized translation system targeting small and medium enterprises in diverse business sectors, focusing on accuracy and ambiguity resolution in cross-cultural communications. [\[paper\].](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9023793)
    - Vietnamese Wordnet We proposed a two-phase methodology for constructing the Vietnamese WordNet, leveraging existing linguistic resources and preserving unique Vietnamese linguistic and cultural nuances. [\[paper\].](https://aclanthology.org/2016.gwc-1.38.pdf)
    - Statistical Machine Translation for [FPT Company](https://fpt.vn): Developed a domain- specific system, sponsored by FPT Company, to streamline Japanese document translation, effectively halving the workload for human translators
