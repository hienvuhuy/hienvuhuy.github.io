### Work and Research Experience
#### Research Experience
- 2021 - present: Research Graduate Student
  - Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) – supervised by Prof. Taro Watanabe and Assoc. Prof. Hidetaka Kamigaito
    - Coreference-guided Neural Machine Translation We proposed a novel method to exploit coreference information in the decoder side of the encoder–decoder based machine translation system at document level.
    - Context-Aware Machine Translation with Coreference Information We introduced a model that explains the decisions made for translation by predicting coreference features in the source input [\[paper\].](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19505)

- 2012 – 2019: Researcher
  - University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University – supervised by Assoc. Prof. Phuong-Thai Nguyen
    - Japanese–Vietnamese Machine Translation System in Business Do- mains(granted by Department of Science and Technology - Hanoi city) We developed a specialized translation system targeting small and medium enterprises in diverse business sectors, focusing on accuracy and ambiguity resolution in cross-cultural communications.
